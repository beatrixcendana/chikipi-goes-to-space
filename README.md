Let's help educators and students to visualize sensory experience through lens of cupola and training astronauts!

# Chikipi’s Journey to Space

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This is an immersive, story-driven website that brings *astronaut training and sensory space experiences* to kids’ eyes. Our hero, **Chikipi the chicken**, guides learners from Earth to orbit — exploring the ISS, the Cupola viewing dome, underwater neutral buoyancy training, microgravity, and more.

We sourced **NASA reference images and factual content** from official NASA sites and transformed them into animated, pop-up visuals and layered narratives that are simple to follow, interactive, and playful.

## 🤖 Use of Artificial Intelligence  
We used **ChatGPT** to assist in generating images for the website (which we then refined).  
For the code structure and scaffolding, we used **Claude Sonet** (by Anthropic) as a starting point, but we adapted, resized images, and edited content heavily. All AI usage and modifications are documented in our metadata.

## 🚀 Why This Matters  

- **Sharpen Critical Thinking**  
  Giving students control over simulations and realistic scenarios encourages **intrinsic motivation in STEM** and develops **critical thinking**.

- **Modern Learning Experience**  
  Our simulation offers a **safe, low-cost**, story-based way to explore complex space science.

- **Access & Scalability**  
  Built to deploy easily in classrooms, libraries, and homes — enabling **wider access to space STEM education**.
