Chikipi’s Journey to the Stars

Chikipi the chicken was watching a YouTube video about the International Space Station (ISS). He became fascinated by life in space and the incredible view from the Cupola—a window where astronauts can see Earth from orbit.

Eager to learn more, Chikipi discovered that astronauts train at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), where they practice for space missions underwater to simulate the feeling of microgravity.

Inspired, Chikipi decided to embark on his own journey of learning. He traveled to the NBL to experience astronaut training—practicing spacewalks, underwater missions, and preparation for research work aboard the ISS.

His dream? To one day look out from the Cupola, float freely in microgravity, and see our planet from the stars.
